<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>A Newcastle miner who was stated to be earning a pound a day has been
  fined ten pounds for neglecting his children. The idea of waiting till
  September 20th and letting Mr. <font class="sc">Smillie</font> neglect
  them does not seem to have occurred to him.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Beyond gardening," says a gossip writer, "Mr. <font
  class="sc">Smillie</font> has few hobbies." At the same time there is no
  doubt he is busy getting together a fine collection of strikes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is said that <font class="sc">Amundsen</font> will not return to
  civilisation this year. If he was thinking of Ireland he isn't missing
  any civilisation worth mentioning.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The <font class="sc">Poet Laureate</font>," says a weekly paper, "has
  not written an ode to British weather." So that can't be the cause of
  it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Wolverhampton man weighing seventeen stone, in charging another with
  assault, said he heard somebody laughing at him, so he looked round. A
  man of that weight naturally would.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"There is work for everybody who likes to work," says Mr. N. <font
  class="sc">Grattan Doyle</font>, M.P. It is this tactless way of rubbing
  it in which annoys so many people.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A contemporary has a letter from a correspondent who signs himself
  "Tube Traveller of Twenty Years' Standing." Somebody ought to offer the
  poor fellow a seat.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In connection with the case of a missing railway-porter one railway
  line has decided to issue notices warning travellers against touching
  porters while they are in motion.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The United States," declares the proprietor of a leading New York
  hotel, "is on the eve of going wet again." A subtle move of this kind,
  with the object of depriving drink of its present popularity, is said to
  be making a strong appeal to the Prohibitionists.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>One London firm is advertising thirty thousand alarum-clocks for sale
  at reduced prices. There is now no excuse for any workman being late at a
  strike.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A centenarian in the Shetlands, says a news agency, has never heard of
  Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd George</font>. We have no wish to brag, but we
  have often seen his name mentioned.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Professor <font class="sc">Petrie's</font> statement that the world
  will only last another two hundred thousand years is a sorry blow to
  those who thought that <i>Chu Chin Chow</i> was in for a long run.
  Otherwise the news has been received quietly.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Nothing useful is ever done in the House of Commons," says a Labour
  speaker. He forgets that the cleaners are at work in the building just
  now.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We are informed that at the Bricklaying contest at the Olympic Games a
  British bricklayer lost easily.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"A dress designer," says a Camomile Street dressmaker in <i>The
  Evening News</i>, "must be born." We always think this is an
  advantage.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A gossip-writer points out that Mr. <font class="sc">Winston
  Churchill's</font> earliest ambition was to be an actor. Our contemporary
  is wise not to disclose the name of the man who talked him out of it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Whatever price is fixed it is impossible to get stone in any
  quantity," says a building trade journal. They have evidently not heard
  of our coal-dealer.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Nothing of any value has been gained by the War," complains a daily
  paper. This slur on the O.B.E. is in shocking taste.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Sunday newspaper deplores that there seems to be no means of
  checking the crime-wave which is still spreading throughout the country.
  If only the Government would publish the amount of American bacon
  recently purchased by the Prisons' Department things might tend to
  improve.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"There is still a great shortage of gold in the country," announces a
  weekly paper. It certainly seems as if our profiteers will soon have to
  be content with having their teeth stopped with bank-notes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We regret to learn that the amateur gardener whose marrows were
  awarded the second prize for cooking-apples at a horticultural show is
  still confined to his bed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A neck-ruffle originally worn by <font class="sc">Queen
  Elizabeth</font> has been stolen from a house in Manchester and has not
  yet been recovered. Any reader noticing a suspicious-looking person
  wearing such an article over her <i>décolleté</i> should immediately
  communicate with the nearest police-station.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Hair tonic, declares the Washington Chief of Police, is growing in
  popularity as a beverage. The danger of this habit has been widely
  advertised by the sad case of a Chicago man who drank three shampoo
  cocktails and afterwards swallowed a hair in his soup.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The mystery of the City gentleman who has been noticed lately going up
  to public telephones and getting immediate answers is now solved. It
  appears that he is a well-known ventriloquist with a weakness for
  practical jokes.</p>

<h2>A WHIFF OF THE BRINY.</h2>

  <p>As I entered the D.E.F. Company's depôt, Melancholy marked me for her
  own. Business reasons&mdash;not my own but the more cogent business
  reasons of an upperling&mdash;had just postponed my summer holiday;
  postponed it with a lofty vagueness to "possibly November. We might be
  able to let you go by then, my boy." November! What would
  Shrimpton-on-Sea be like even at the beginning of November? Lovely
  sea-bathing, delicious boating, enchanting picnics on the sand? I didn't
  think. Melancholy tatooed me all over with anchors and pierced hearts, to
  show that I was her very own, not to be taken away.</p>

  <p>I clasped my head in my hands and gazed in dumb agony at the menu
  card. A kind waitress listened with one ear.</p>

  <p>"Poached egg and bacon&mdash;two rashers," I murmured.</p>

  <p>While I waited I crooned softly to myself:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Poor disappointed Georgie. Life seems so terribly sad.</p>
      <p>All the bacon and eggs in the world, dear, won't make you a happy lad."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>When the dish was brought I eyed it sadly. Sadly I raised a mouthful
  of bacon to my lips....</p>

  <p>Swish!!! The exclamation-marks signify the suddenness with which the
  train swept into the station. I leapt down on to the platform and drew a
  long breath. The sea! In huge whiffs the ozone rolled into my nostrils. I
  gurgled with delight. Everything smelt of the dear old briny: the little
  boys running about with spades and pails; the great basketsful of fish;
  the blue jerseys of the red-faced men who, at rare intervals, toiled upon
  the deep. At the far end of the platform I saw the reddest face of all,
  that of my dear old landlord. I rushed to meet him....</p>

  <p>Ah me, ah me! The incrusted-papered walls of the depôt girt me in
  again. I took another mouthful of bacon&mdash;a larger one....</p>

  <p>Bang! Someone was thumping on the door of my bathing-machine. What a
  glorious scent of salt rose from the sea-washed floor! "Are you coming
  out?" asked a persuasive voice. "No, no, no!" I shouted joyously. "I am
  going in." What a dive! I never knew before how superlatively graceful my
  dives could be. Away through the breakers with a racing stroke. Over on
  my back, kicking fountains at the sun. In this warm water I should stay
  in for hours and hours and....</p>

  <p>Pah! That horrible incrusted paper back again! I bolted the remaining
  rasher....</p>

  <p>The boat rocked gently in a glassy sea. They were almost climbing over
  the gunwale in their eagerness to be caught. Lovely wet shining wriggly
  fellows; all the varieties of the fishmonger's slab and more. In season
  or out, they didn't care; they thought only of doing honour to my line.
  No need in future for me to envy the little boys on the river-bank who
  pulled in fish after fish when I never got a bite. How delightfully salt
  the fish smelt! And the sun drew out the scent of salt from the gently
  lapping waves. It was all so quiet and restful. Almost could I have
  slumbered, even as I pulled them in and in and....</p>

  <p>The waitress must have giggled. Once again the incrusted paper leered
  at me in ail its horrible pink incrustiness. There was no bacon left on
  my plate. But the delicious scent of salt still lingered. Alas, my
  holiday was over! I must speed me or I should miss the train to town.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye!" I shouted to the manageress and shook her by the hand. She
  seemed surprised. "Such a happy time," I assured her. "I wish I could
  have it all over again."</p>

  <p>She said something which I could not hear. Sea-bathing tends to make
  me a little deaf.</p>

  <p>"If I have forgotten anything&mdash;my pyjamas or my shaving
  strop&mdash;would you be so kind as to send them on? Good-bye again."</p>

  <p>Something fluttered to the floor. The manageress stooped. I was just
  passing through the portals.</p>

  <p>"You have forgotten this," she called.</p>

  <p>It was the dear little square piece of paper which contained my bill.
  I looked at it in amazement.</p>

  <p>"What!" I exclaimed&mdash;"only one-and-twopence for a poached egg and
  bacon and all that salt flavour thrown in?"</p>

<h2>THE ART OF POETRY.</h2>

<p class="center">IV.</p>

  <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Before I pass to the subject of my lecture
  today I must deal briefly with a personal matter of some delicacy. Since
  I began this series of lectures on the Art of Poetry I notice that the
  new Professor of Poetry at Oxford, Mr. W.P. <font class="sc">Ker</font>,
  in what I think is questionable taste, has delivered an inaugural lecture
  on the <i>same</i> subject under the <i>same</i> title. On the question
  of good taste I do not wish to say much, except that I should have
  thought that any colleague of mine, even an entirely new Professor in a
  provincial university, would have recognised the propriety of at least
  communicating to me his intention before committing this monstrous
  plagiarism.</p>

  <p>However, as I say, on that aspect of the matter I do not propose to
  dwell, though it does seem to me that decency imposes certain limits to
  that kind of academic piracy, and that those limits the Professor has
  overstepped. In these fermenting days of licence and indiscipline persons
  in responsible positions at our seats of learning have a great burden of
  example to bear before the world, and if it were to go forth that actions
  of this type may be taken with impunity by highly-paid Professors then
  indeed we are not far from Bimetallism and the breaking-up of laws.</p>

  <p>Now let us glance for a moment at the substance of the lecture. I
  should have been glad if Professor <font class="sc">Ker</font> had had
  the courtesy to show it to me before it was delivered, instead of my
  having to wait till it was printed and buy it in a shop, because I might
  have induced him to repair the more serious errors and omissions in his
  work. For really, when you come to analyse the lecture, what thin and
  bodyless stuff it is. Let me at once pay tribute to my colleague's
  scholarship and learning, to the variety of his citations. But, after
  all, anyone can buy a Quotation Dictionary and quote bits out of <font
  class="sc">Swinburne</font>. That surely&mdash;(see <font
  class="sc">Freidrich's</font> <i>Crime and Quotation</i>, pp.
  246-9)&mdash;is not the whole task of a Professor of Poetry.</p>

  <p>Such a man, if he is to earn his pay, must be able&mdash;</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) to show how poetry is written;</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) to write poetry;</p>

  <p>and it is no good his attempting (<i>a</i>) in the absence of
  (<i>b</i>). It is no good teaching a man to slope arms if you are unable
  to slope arms yourself, because a moment will come when he says, "Well,
  how the dickens <i>do</i> you slope them?" It is no good professing
  lawn-tennis and saying, "Top-spin is imparted by drawing the racquet up
  and over," and so on, if, when you try to impart top-spin yourself, the
  ball disappears on to the District Railway. Still less is it useful if
  you deliver a long address to the student, saying, "H.L. <font
  class="sc">Doherty</font> was a good player, and so was <font
  class="sc">Renshaw</font>, and I well remember the game between <font
  class="sc">McLoughlin</font> and <font class="sc">Wilding</font>, because
  <font class="sc">Wilding</font> hit the ball over the net more often than
  <font class="sc">McLoughlin</font> did."</p>

  <p>Those students who have attended my lectures more regularly than
  others&mdash;and I am sorry there are not more of them&mdash;will do me
  the justice to remember that I have put forward no theory of writing
  which I was not prepared to illustrate in practice from my own work. My
  colleague, so far as I can discover, makes one single attempt at
  practical assistance; and even that is a minor plagiarism from one of my
  own lectures. He makes a good deal of play with what <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg 165]</span> he
  calls the principle and influence of the Italian Canzone, which simply
  means having a lot of ten-syllable lines and a few six-syllable ones.
  Students will remember that in our second lecture we wrote a poem on that
  principle, which finished:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Toroodle&mdash;umti&mdash;oodle&mdash;umti&mdash;knife (or strife)</p>
      <p class="i6">Where have they put my hat?</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>That lecture was prepared on May 27th; my colleague's lecture was
  delivered on June 5th. It is clear to me that in the interval&mdash;by
  what discreditable means I know not&mdash;he obtained access to my
  manuscript and borrowed the idea, thinking to cloak his guilt by specious
  talk about the Italian <i>Canzone</i>. The device of offering stolen
  goods under a new name is an old one, and will help him little; the jury
  will know what to think.</p>

  <p>Apart from this single piece of (second-hand) instruction, what
  contribution does he make to the student's knowledge of the Art of
  Poetry? He makes no reference to comic poetry at all; apparently he has
  never <i>heard</i> of the Limerick, and I have the gravest doubts whether
  he can write one, though that, I admit, is a severe test. I am prepared
  however to give him a public opportunity of establishing his fitness for
  his post, and with that end I propose to put to him the following
  problems, and if his answers are satisfactory I shall most willingly
  modify my criticisms; but he must write on one side of the paper only and
  number his pages in the top right-hand corner.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Problems.</i></p>

  <p>(1) What is the metre of:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"And the other grasshopper jumped right over the other grasshopper's back."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>(2) Finish the uncompleted Limerick given in my Second Lecture,
  beginning:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>There was a young man who said "<i>Hell!</i></p>
      <p>I don't think I feel very well."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>(3) In your inaugural lecture you ask, "Is it true, or not, that the
  great triumphs of poetical art often come suddenly?" The answer you give
  is most unsatisfactory; give a better one now, illustrating the answer
  from your own works.</p>

  <p>(4) Write a Ballade of which the refrain is either&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(<i>a</i>) The situation is extremely grave;</p>
      <p class="i16">or</p>
      <p>(<i>b</i>) The Empire is not what it was;</p>
      <p class="i16">or</p>
      <p>(<i>c</i>) We lived to see Lord Birkenhead.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><font class="sc">Note</font>.&mdash;Extra marks will be given for an
  attempt at (<i>b</i>) because of the shortage of rhymes to
  <i>was</i>.</p>

  <p>(5) What would you do in the following circumstances? In May you have
  sent a poem to an Editor, ending with the lines&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The soldiers cheered and cheered again&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i2">It was the <font class="sc">Prince of Wales</font>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>On July 20th the Editor writes and says that he likes the poem very
  much, and wishes to print it in his August number, but would be glad if
  you could make the poem refer to Mr. or Mrs. <font class="sc">Douglas
  Fairbanks</font> instead of the <font class="sc">Prince</font>. He must
  have the proof by the first post to-morrow as he is going to press. Show,
  how you would reconstruct your last verse.</p>

  <p>(6) Consider the following passages&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(i) I love little pussy,</p>
      <p class="i6">Her coat is so <i>warm</i>,</p>
      <p class="i4">And if I don't hurt her</p>
      <p class="i6">She'll do me no <i>harm</i>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(ii) Who put her <i>in</i>?</p>
      <p class="i4"> Little Tommy <i>Green</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) Carefully amend the above so that they rhyme properly.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) Do you as a matter of principle approve of these kinds of
  rhyme?</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) If not, do you approve of them in (i) <font

  </blockquote>
<p class="center"><font class="sc">From</font> "<font class="sc">The Margotist's Reminiscences</font>."</p>

  <p>By the Author of <i>Statesmen I Have Influenced</i>; <i>My Wonderful
  Life</i>; <i>The Souls' Awakener</i>; <i>The Elusive Diary</i>, <i>etc.,
  etc.</i></p>

  <p>One of my dearest friends in the early nineteen hundreds was Mr.
  Sadrock. I have known eleven Prime Ministers in my time and have
  assurances from all, signed and witnessed, that but for me and my
  vivacious encouragement they would never have pulled through; but with
  none was I on terms of such close communion as with Mr. Sadrock, who not
  only asked my advice on every occasion of importance, but spent many of
  his waking hours in finding rhymes to my name. Some of his four-lined
  couplets in my honour could not be either wittier or more charming as
  compliments.</p>

  <p>He often averred that no one could amuse him as I did. He laughed once
  for half-an-hour on end when I said, "It takes a Liberal to be a Tory;"
  and on another occasion when I said, "The essence of Home Rule is, like
  charity, that it begins abroad." Nothing but the circumstance that he was
  already happily married prevented him from proposing to me.</p>

  <p>Mr. Sadrock is now to many people only a name; but in his day he was a
  force to compare with which we have at this moment only one statesman and
  he is temporarily out of office.</p>

  <p>The odd thing is that if the ordinary person were to be asked what Mr.
  Sadrock was famous for, he would probably reply, For his devotion to
  <font class="sc">Homer</font> and the Established Church. But the joke is
  that when I was with him in 1902 he was frivolous on both these subjects.
  It was, I remember, in the private room at the House of Commons set apart
  for Prime Ministers, to which, being notoriously so socially couth, I
  always had a private key&mdash;the only one ever given to a
  woman&mdash;and he was more than usually delightful.</p>

  <p>This is what was said:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Mr. Sadrock</font></i> (<i>mixing himself an egg
  nogg</i>). Will you join me?</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Myself.</font></i> No, thank you. But I like to
  see you applying yourself to Subsidiary Studies to the Art of Butler.</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Mr. Sadrock</font></i> (<i>roaring with
  laughter</i>). That's very good. Some day you must put your best things
  into a book.</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Myself.</font></i> You bet.</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Mr. Sadrock.</font></i> I wonder why it is that
  you make me so frank. It is your wonderful sympathetic understanding, I
  suppose. I long to tell you something now.</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Myself</font></i> (<i>affecting not to care</i>).
  Do. I am secrecy itself.</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Mr. Sadrock.</font></i> Would it surprise you to
  know that I am privily a Dissenter? Do you know that I often steal away
  in a false beard to attend the services of Hard-Shell Baptists and
  Plymouth Brethren?</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Myself.</font></i> I hope I am no longer capable
  of feeling anything so <i>démodé</i> as surprise.</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Mr. Sadrock.</font></i> And that I prefer
  <i>Robert Elsmere</i> to the <i>Iliad</i>?</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Myself.</font></i> May I print those declarations
  in my book?</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Mr. Sadrock.</font></i> Some day, yes, but not
  yet, not yet.</p>

<p class="center"><i>To the Editor of</i> "<i>The Monday Times</i>."</p>

  <p><font class="sc">Sir</font>,&mdash;I find it necessary, in the
  interests of truth and of respect for the memory of my uncle, Mr.
  Sadrock, to contest the accuracy of the Margotist's report of
  conversations with him in 1902. To begin with, my uncle died in 1898,
  four years before the alleged interview. She could therefore not have
  talked with him in 1902; and the <i>locale</i> of this meeting, the Prime
  Minister's room, becomes peculiarly fantastic. Secondly, no member of his
  family&mdash;and they saw him constantly&mdash;ever heard him utter
  anything resembling the sentiments which the Margotist attributes to him.
  Mr. Sadrock was both an undeviating Churchman and a devotee of <font
  class="sc">Homer</font> to the end of his life.</p>

<p class="center">I am, etc.,</p>
<p class="author"><font class="sc">Theophilus Sadrock</font>.</p>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">The Margotist's Reply</font>.</p>

  <p><font class="sc">Sir</font>,&mdash;I have read Mr. Theophilus
  Sadrock's letter and am surprised by its tone. If Mr. Sadrock did not
  make use of the words that I attribute to him how could I have set them
  down? Because I was writing unobserved all the time he was talking, and I
  could produce the notes if they were, to others, legible enough for it to
  be worth while; surreptitious writing must necessarily be indistinct at
  times. As for the question of time and place, that is a mere quibble. Mr.
  Sadrock was alive when we had our talk, and I am sorry if I have misdated
  it. The talk remains. May I add that it is very astonishing to me to find
  people with the effrontery to suggest that they knew their illustrious
  relatives better than strangers could. Everyone is aware that the last
  place to go to for evidence as to a man is to his kith and kin. When my
  book appears there will be a few corrections; but in the main I stand by
  the motto which I invented for Chamberlain one evening: "What I have
  written I have written."</p>

  <p>Before leaving our consideration of Sadrock's Homeric studies it is
  however necessary to point out that late in life he made a very curious
  recantation. In a book of memoirs, published in 1920, by one who was in a
  position to acquire special information, it is stated in his own words
  that Sadrock preferred <i>Robert Elsmere</i> to the <i>Iliad</i>; while
  during the same conversation he confessed to a passion for the services
  of Dissenters, which, he said, he often frequented <i>incognito</i>. No
  biographer can disregard such admissions, and we must revise our opinion
  of the great statesman accordingly.</p>

<h2>THE REVOLT OF YOUTH.</h2>

  <p>We publish a few selected letters from the mass of correspondence
  which has reached us in connection with the controversy initiated by "A
  Bewildered Parent" in <i>The Morning Post</i>:</p>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">A Leguminous Laudation.</font></p>

  <p><font class="sc">Sir</font>,&mdash;I confess I cannot share the
  anxiety of the "Bewildered Parent" who complains of the child of two and
  a half years who addressed her learned parent as "Old bean." As a
  convinced Montessorian I recognise in the appellation a gratifying
  evidence of that self-expression which cannot begin too young. Moreover
  there is nothing derogatory in the phrase; on the contrary I am assured
  on the best authority that it is a term of endearment rather than
  reproach. But, above all, as a Vegetarian I welcome the choice of the
  term as an indication of the growth of the revolt against carnivorous
  brutality. If the child in question had called her parent a "saucy
  kipper" or "a silly old sausage" there would have been reasonable ground
  for resentment. But comparison with a bean involves no obloquy, but
  rather panegyric. The bean is one of the noblest of vegetables and is
  exceptionally rich in calories, protein, casein, carbo-hydrates, thymol,
  hexamyl, piperazine, salicylic dioxide, and permanganate of popocatapetl.
  This a learned parent, if his learning was real, ought to have recognised
  at once, instead of foolishly exploiting a fancied grievance.</p>

<p class="center">Yours farinaceously,</p>

<p class="author"><font class="sc">Josiah Vedgeley</font>.</p>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">The Old Complaint.</font></p>

  <p><font class="sc">Sir</font>,&mdash;Some sixty years ago I was rebuked
  by my father for addressing him as "Governor." Thirty years later I was
  seriously offended with my own son for calling me an "old mug." He in
  turn, though not by any means a learned man, has within the last few
  weeks been irritated by his school-boy son derisively addressing him as
  an "old dud." The duel between fathers and sons is as old as the
  everlasting hills, and the rebels of one generation become the fogeys of
  the next. I have no doubt that in moments of expansion the young
  Marcellus alluded to his august parent as "<i>faba antiqua</i>."</p>

<p class="center">Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="author"><font class="sc">Senex</font>.</p>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">A Triple Life.</font></p>

  <p><font class="sc">Sir</font>,&mdash;As a middle-aged mother I do not
  appeal for your sympathy, I merely wish to describe my position, the
  difficulties of which might no doubt be paralleled in hundreds of other
  households. I have three children whose characteristics may be thus
  briefly summarised:&mdash;</p>

  <p>(1) Pamela, aged nineteen, is an ultra-modern young woman. She hates
  politics of all shades, but adores <font class="sc">Scriabine</font>,
  <font class="sc">Stravinsky</font> and <font class="sc">Benedetto
  Croce</font>. She smokes cigars, wears male attire and has a perfect
  command of the art of ornamental objurgation.</p>

  <p>(2) Gerald, aged twenty-three, is war-weary; resentful of all
  authority; "bored stiff" by any music save of the syncopated brand, and
  he divides his time between Jazz-dancing with the dismal fervour of a
  gloomy dean and attending meetings of pro-Bolshevist extremists.</p>

  <p>(3) Anthony, aged twenty-six, is a soldier, a "regular"; restrained in
  speech, somewhat old-fashioned in his tastes. This summer he spent his
  leave fishing in Scotland and took with him two books&mdash;the <i>Life
  of Stonewall Jackson</i> and the <i>Bible</i>. It is hardly necessary to
  add that Gerald is not on speaking terms with him.</p>

  <p>As for myself, while anxious to keep in touch with my wayward brood, I
  find the strain of accommodating myself to their varied requirements
  almost more than I can stand. Pamela can only endure my companionship on
  the conditions that I smoke (which makes me ill); that I emulate the
  excesses of her lurid lingo (which makes me squirm), and that I paint my
  face (which makes me look like a modern Messalina, which I am not).
  Gerald is prepared to accept me as a "pal," provided that I play David to
  his Saul by regaling him on Sunday mornings with negroid melodies, which
  he punctuates with snorts on the trombone. If he knew that I went to
  early morning service all would be at an end between us. Finally, Anthony
  wants me to remain as I was and really am. So you see that I have to lead
  not a dual but a triple life, and am only spared the necessity of making
  it quadruple by the fact that my husband is fortunately dead. As Pamela
  gracefully remarked the other day, "It was a good thing for poor father
  that he went West to sing bass in the heavenly choir before we grew up."
  In conclusion I ought to admit that my future is not without prospects of
  alleviation. Pamela has just announced her engagement to an archdeacon of
  pronounced Evangelical views; Gerald is meditating a prolonged tour in
  New Guinea with a Bolshevist mission; Anthony contemplates neither
  matrimony nor expatriation.</p>

<h2>SAND SPORTS.</h2>

  <p>Two or three hundred yards behind the sandhills, which seem to be
  deserted but are really full of sudden hollows, with embarrassing little
  bathing tents in them, the village sports have just been held. They took
  place in a sloping grass field kindly lent for the occasion by Mr. Bates.
  This means that you paid a shilling to enter the field, whereas on other
  days you can picnic in it or play cricket in it without paying anything
  at all. Mr. Bates is a kind of absentee landlord so far as we are
  concerned, for he is the butcher at Framford, four miles away, and only
  brings the proceeds of his butchery to us on Tuesdays and Fridays, which
  is the reason why on Mondays and Thursdays one usually has eggs and bacon
  for dinner.</p>

  <p>It was an interesting afternoon for many reasons, most of all perhaps
  because many of the visitors saw each other for the first time in
  clothes&mdash;in land clothes, I mean&mdash;and it is wonderful how much
  smarter some of them looked than when popping red or brown faces, with
  lank wisps of hair on them, out of the brine.</p>

  <p>Some of the athletic events were open, like the Atlantic Sea, and some
  close, like the Conferences at Lympne, but very few of the visitors
  competed in any of them. I don't think any of us fancied our chances
  overmuch, but personally I was a little bitter about the three-mile
  bicycle race, because there were three prizes and only three competitors.
  I am past my prime at this particular sport, but as it happened one of
  the three broke his gear-chain somewhere about the seventh lap, and it
  was a long time before he mended it and rode triumphantly past the
  finishing flag. I felt then that I had missed what was probably my first
  and last chance of securing an Olympic palm.</p>

  <p>The whole affair struck me as being very well managed; dull events,
  like the high jump and putting the shot, being held quietly in a corner
  by the hedge, whilst the really interesting things, like the sack race
  and the egg and spoon race, went on in the middle. We used potatoes
  instead of eggs, but whether there was a system of handicapping according
  to the weight and age of the potatoes I was unable to determine. I do
  feel confident, however, that that girl with the yellow hair and the
  striped skirt to whom the first prize was quite incorrectly awarded by
  the judges had put some treacle&mdash;But there, I will be
  magnanimous.</p>

  <p>The postman was a great success. He had acquired a light suit of
  overalls, on which he had painted three large red stars, using, I hope,
  Government red ink, and with black cheeks and a floured nose footed it
  solemnly to the music of the Framford Comrades' Band. He also ran
  underneath the lath at the high jump and tumbled down in trying to put
  the shot. All round the field children could be heard asking, "What
  <i>is</i> he doing, Mummy?" and, when they were told, "Hush, dears, he's
  doing it for a <i>joke</i>," their eyes danced and they tried for a
  moment to control their emotion and then broke into shrieks of laughter.
  All the difficult open events which were not won by a young man in
  puce-coloured shorts were won by a friend of his in a yellow shirt. I
  have an idea that these two young men came from Framford and go round
  doing this kind of thing and getting prizes for it, just as Mr. Bates
  goes round selling his beef.</p>

  <p>Amidst all this fun and frolic, if you went up to the top of one of
  the sandhills and looked across the blue bay to the little seaport
  opposite, you saw that it was also emptied of its folk this pious
  afternoon and was in fact holding aquatic revels. Little fishing-boats
  with brown sails were turning about a given mark. There were rowing races
  and diving competitions and a greasy pole and very probably a comic man
  dressed up as a buoy.</p>

  <p>I have pondered deeply over these twin feasts, and it has occurred to
  me that, whilst land sports and water sports are both of them very good
  things in their way, neither expresses the real genius of a maritime
  resort, and also that we visitors, if we are too shy to enter with gusto
  into the local games, ought to provide some suitable entertainment in
  return. I have compiled therefore a programme of a Grand Beach Gala for
  next week, and have had a notice put up in the post-office window
  inviting entries. Not many people buy stamps at the post-office, but, as
  you get bacon and spades and buckets and jam there, it is a pretty
  popular emporium, and I think my list of events should prove an
  attractive one. It runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. <i>Pebble and Tent Competition.</i>&mdash;Fathers of families only.
  To be run if possible at low tide on a wet and windy day. Competitors to
  leave starting post in ordinary attire, enter tent, emerge in bathing
  costume, strike tents, sprint over shingle to the sea, swim to a given
  point, return, pitch tents, dress and run to winning-post.</p>

  <p><font class="sc">First Prize</font>, a ham sandwich, with real
  sand.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Sock Race.</i>&mdash;Under ten. Competitors to start barefooted
  in rock-pools and race at the sound of a dinner-bell to nurses, have feet
  dried, put on shoes and stockings and run to row of buns at top of beach.
  First bun down wins. Points deducted for sand in socks.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Hundred Yards Paddle Dash.</i>&mdash;To be run along the edge of
  surf. Handicap by position. Tallest competitor to have deepest station.
  Open to all ages and sexes. Feet to be lifted clear of the water at every
  stride. Properly raced this is a fine frothy event, productive of the
  greatest enthusiasm, especially if the trousers come unrolled.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Sand Castle Contest.</i>&mdash;Open to all families of eight.
  Twenty minutes time limit. Largest castle wins. Moats must contain real
  sea-water.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Impromptu Picnic.</i>&mdash;Ladies only. Materials must be
  collected from the village shops, brought down to beach and spread out at
  winning flag. For the purpose of this competition the sports must take
  place on a Thursday, when the weekly visit of the greengrocer coincides
  with one of the bi-weekly visits of the baker from Framford. Eggs and
  butter must be obtained at the Mill Farm, and you can do the rest at the
  post-office.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Fifty Yards Hat Race.</i>&mdash;Under five. Fathers to be seated
  in a row on beach. Competitors to remove fathers' hats, run twenty-five
  yards, fill hats with sand, return and replace hats.</p>

  <p>In order to prevent any ill-feeling that might arise from the thought
  that I had practised any of these races in private beforehand I have
  elected to be the judge.</p>

<h2>THE ROOM AT THE BACK.</h2>

  <blockquote>
  <p>[A story of the supernatural, which should not be read late at night
  by persons of weak nerves.]</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Outwardly, "Chatholme" was as all the other villas in Dunmoral Avenue,
  which were just detached enough to allow the butcher's boy to squeeze
  himself and his basket&mdash;and perhaps the cook&mdash;between any two
  of them, and differed from each other in nothing but names, numbers and
  window-curtains.</p>

  <p>And the interior of the house, when the Pottigrews took possession of
  it, seemed equally commonplace. There is no need to show you all over it,
  but if you intend to peruse this narrative, in spite of the warning
  above, it is desirable that you should at least inspect the
  ground-floor.</p>

  <p>On one side of the hall, which was faintly illumined in the daytime by
  a fanlight, was the drawing-room; on the other side was the dining-room,
  and behind the dining-room was a smaller room with a French-window
  looking on to the back-garden, which probably was described by the
  house-agents as the "morning-room," but was by Mr. Pottigrew designated
  his "study."</p>

  <p>Prosaic enough, you will say. And yet there was that about the
  ground-floor of "Chatholme" which was anything but matter-of-fact, as the
  Pottigrews began to discover before they had been in residence many
  days.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Pottigrew was the first to "sense" something out of the ordinary.
  She was of Manx origin, and therefore peculiarly sensitive to
  "influences;" one of those uncomfortable people who cannot visit such
  places as Hampton Court or the Tower without vibrating like
  harp-strings.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottigrew, however, was of the duller fibre of which cyclists
  rather than psychists are made; and when, on his return from the City one
  afternoon, his wife tried to get him to appreciate a certain eeriness in
  the atmosphere of the new home, he sniffed it dutifully, and declared
  that he could detect nothing but a confounded smell of onions.</p>

  <p>"That's because they <i>won't</i> remember to shut the kitchen door,"
  Mrs. Pottigrew explained. "But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, it can't be the drains, because they've just been tested," said
  Mr. Pottigrew impatiently. And, like a stout materialist, he muttered,
  "Imagination!" as he strolled away to the sanctuary of his study, little
  guessing how his own imagination was about to be stimulated.</p>

  <p>(Look here&mdash;this is where the creepy business begins. If, on
  consideration, you feel you'd rather read about cricket or politics or
  something, I'll excuse you.)</p>

  <p>A little later, as Mrs. Pottigrew was crossing the hall, she was
  stopped short by a strange, gasping choky sound which came from the
  study. There followed the crash of a chair being overturned; the door
  opened and her husband staggered out with scared eyes in a face as white
  as marble, and beads of sweat on his brow.</p>

  <p>When a stiff brandy had restored the power of speech to Mr. Pottigrew,
  he described the remarkable and alarming seizure he had just
  experienced.</p>

  <p>He had turned his arm-chair to the French-window, he said, with the
  intention of enjoying a quiet smoke, and no sooner had he seated himself
  and leaned back than an indescribable feeling of suffocation had crept
  upon him, and at the same time he had been aware of a curious loss of
  control over his jaws, so that he had been unable to prevent his mouth
  opening to its widest extent. When he had tried to rise to his feet an
  invisible force had seemed to be holding him down, and it was only by a
  tremendous effort of will that he had managed to keep his senses and
  struggle to the door.</p>

  <p>He resolutely refused to see a doctor, but, deciding that the attack
  was a warning that he had been overdoing it, he retired forthwith to bed.
  By the morning he felt so well that he prescribed for himself a few quiet
  days by the sea. And so he packed his bag and took himself off by an
  early train to Brighton.</p>

  <p>That afternoon was marked by another disagreeable occurrence. After
  the way of her kind, Mrs. Pottigrew's Aunt Charlotte was attracted by the
  idea of using a room from which normally the female members of the
  household were excluded. So she took her needlework into the study and
  prepared to spend a quiet hour or so in the armchair facing the
  French-window.</p>

  <p>Hardly had she settled down when she too experienced the same feeling
  of suffocation and the same involuntary opening of the jaws which Mr.
  Pottigrew had described. She struggled against it, but, lacking the
  will-power of her robust nephew-by-marriage, she was overcome by
  unconsciousness. When she came to, a little dazed and faint, a few
  moments later, she was dismayed to discover that her expensive
  dental-plate&mdash;a full set&mdash;was lying on the floor, shattered
  beyond repair.</p>

  <p>Not being a person of vivid imagination, she attributed her transient
  illness to intense sympathy with Mr. Pottigrew, and resigned herself to a
  diet of slops until she could be furnished with new means of
  mastication.</p>

  <p>Next day, a Saturday, came the climax. Early in the evening an urgent
  telegram summoned Mr. Pottigrew back from Brighton. Hastening home, he
  was received by a wife distraught.</p>

  <p>"What did I tell you?" she wailed. "Send for Sir <font
  class="sc">Conan Doyle</font>. Poor dear Aubrey! The doctor is upstairs
  with him."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottigrew hurriedly ascended to the bedroom of his son and heir, a
  fine healthy youth, just of an age to appreciate his father's cigars.
  (This, of course, is a pre-Budget story.)</p>

  <p>The young fellow lying upon the bed smiled bravely as his father
  entered, but Mr. Pottigrew was shocked to see that he smiled with
  toothless gums. A grave professional-looking man rose from the bedside
  and beckoned Mr. Pottigrew out of the room. <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg 175]</span></p>

  <p>"This extraordinary case, Sir," said the doctor as he closed the door
  behind him, "is the outcome of causes quite beyond the present scope of
  the medical profession. The sound, strong, firm teeth&mdash;a splendid
  set&mdash;of a healthy young man do not jump out of his head of their own
  accord, every one of them, for any natural reason."</p>

  <p>He paused and lowered his voice as he continued: "I am afraid, Mr.
  Pottigrew, however reluctant we may be to admit the possibility, that
  there is no doubt that you have taken a haunted house. The previous
  tenant was a dentist&mdash;poor Mr. Acres. The room which is your study
  was his operating room. <i>He died in that room while administering gas
  to himself preparatory to extracting his own teeth.</i>"</p>

<h2>HOW TO BUILD A HOUSE.</h2>

  <p>The only way to build a house properly is to employ an architect to
  build it for you. All the best houses are built by architects&mdash;any
  architect will tell you that. But of course you will always be allowed to
  say that <i>you</i> built it, so it will come to the same thing.</p>

  <p>The walls of an architect's office are covered with drawings of
  enormous public buildings which the architect has erected in every
  capital of Europe. There are also a few of the statelier homes of England
  which he has put up in his spare time.</p>

  <p>While you are waiting you compare these with your own scheme of the
  six-roomed villa you propose to build.</p>

  <p>At last you are ushered into the presence and unless a stove-pipe
  protruding from your waistcoat pocket suggests that you are travelling in
  somebody's radiators you will probably be asked to sit down, and may even
  be given a cigarette. There is no difficulty in opening your business.
  The architect can see at a glance what you have come for and says quite
  simply, "You want to build a house?"</p>

  <p>"I do," you reply.</p>

  <p>"How many reception rooms?"</p>

  <p>This rather staggers you. You had not intended to have any reception
  rooms at all. You never give receptions. All you wanted was a dining-room
  and a drawing-room, and a study with a round window over the
  fire-place.</p>

  <p>But it is evidently impossible to confide this to the architect. All
  you can do is to reply as naturally as you can:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"About half-a-dozen."</p>

  <p>"Eight reception rooms," says the architect. "And how many
  bedrooms?"</p>

  <p>"I don't really know; about one each."</p>

  <p>"Twenty bedrooms," suggests the architect (there are three in your
  family). "And did you say a garage to hold two cars?"</p>

  <p>By this time you realise that you are engaged in a game something like
  auction bridge and so far your opponent has done all the
  over-calling.</p>

  <p>"Double two cars!" you cry excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Five cars," rejoins the Architect.</p>

  <p>"Six cars!"</p>

  <p>"Garage to hold six cars," repeats the Architect, confessing defeat.
  "You are, of course, aware that a house on this scale will cost you at
  least twenty thousand pounds?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," you reply, and you honestly think it would be cheap at
  the price.</p>

  <p>After this the only thing to do is to get away as quickly as possible.
  It would be pure bathos to suggest any of your wife's labour-saving
  devices, or introduce the subject of that circular bath-room with a
  circular bath hanging by chains from the ceiling and a spirit-stove under
  it&mdash;your pet invention. Recall a pressing engagement, shake the
  architect firmly by the hand and promise to come and see him next Tuesday
  about details. In the interval you can compose a letter at your leisure,
  informing him that in view of the high cost of materials, etc., etc., you
  have decided to postpone the building of your house, but you desire to
  build <i>at once</i> a gardener's cottage (so that the gardener can be
  getting the grounds into order) containing one dining-room, one
  drawing-room, one study (with one round window), three bedrooms, one
  circular bathroom (with one circular bath) and one tool-shed to hold one
  tool.</p>

  <p>Even so you will probably have to make concessions. Your window will
  be hexagonal and your bath square. But your worries are over. The
  architect will choose a builder and between them they will build your
  house during the next six years, which you will spend in lodgings. It is
  a long time to wait, certainly, but you will find plenty of amusement in
  occasionally counting the number of bricks that have been laid since last
  time. And then in 1926, as you smoke your pipe in your study and gaze out
  of your hexagonal window, you will not covet the Paradise of <font
  class="sc">Adam</font>, the first gardener.</p>

<h2>THE DISSIMULATION OF SUZANNE.</h2>

  <p>The telephone bell rang just as I was beginning breakfast.</p>

  <p>"What is your number, please?" asked an imperious voice.</p>

  <p>In an emergency I never can remember my own number.</p>

  <p>"Just hold on a minute while I look it up," I begged. Feverishly I
  turned over the leaves of the telephone directory and, cutting with a
  blunt finger the page containing the small advertisement that keeps my
  name before the public eye, at last found and transmitted the desired
  information.</p>

  <p>"Don't go away," said the voice again, this time with a shade of
  weariness in its tone. "Chesterminster wants you."</p>

  <p>I wasn't going away, because before Suzanne left me to visit her
  relatives in Middleshire I had vowed that nothing would induce me to do
  so. But Chesterminster wanted me. What should that portend?</p>

  <p>"Tell them," I declaimed into the mouthpiece while I instinctively
  posed for the camera, "that I feel greatly honoured by their invitation
  and in other circumstances I should have been delighted to come forward
  as their Candidate. The Parliamentary history of Chesterminster
  constitutes one of the most romantic chapters in the chronicles of
  England; but just now I am busy writing verses for next week's <i>Back
  Chat</i>, so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you will keep on talking to yourself you won't get connected,"
  interrupted the voice. "You're thr-r-rough, Chesterminster."</p>

  <p>"Are you Chelsea niner-seven-double-seven?" inquired a new voice, a
  little more distant but not so haughty.</p>

  <p>"No, nine I mean niner-double-seven-seven," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Same thing," said the voice of Chesterminster. "Stokehampton wants
  you."</p>

  <p>"Tell them&mdash;" I began, but my oratory was drowned by a rapid
  succession of small explosions, and out of this unholy crepitation
  emerged a still small voice which said, "Is that you, darling?" Then I
  suddenly remembered that Stokehampton is Suzanne's relatives' nearest
  town of call.</p>

  <p>"They want you to come tomorrow for the week-end," said Suzanne. "I
  lied to them and said you were busy working, but they said you can have
  the library to yourself whenever you want it, and spoke so nicely about
  you that I couldn't refuse to ring you up. Besides, I want you to come,
  and the figs and the mulberries are in splendid form."</p>

  <p>Suzanne knows that my idea of Heaven is a garden full of fig-trees and
  mulberry-bushes at the appropriate season of the year. But it was raining
  hard, and I abominate week-ends; and Suzanne's relatives are well-meaning
  folk who always want to arrange your day for you.</p>

  <p>"No, Suzanne," I said, "emphatically, no. I can't think of a
  convincing excuse at the moment, so you'd better say I'll be delighted to
  come. But tomorrow morning you'll get a wire from me announcing that I'm
  sick of the palsy&mdash;no, malaria, which they know I sometimes
  get&mdash;and that'll give you a good ground for returning yourself
  tomorrow. Your three minutes is up. Good-bye."</p>

  <p>With the inspiration still fresh upon me I wrote out the telegram and
  rang for Evangeline.</p>

  <p>"Evangeline," I said, "I may possibly be detained in bed tomorrow
  morning. In case that should happen"&mdash;she never betrayed even a
  flicker of the eye, although she could, an she would, tell Suzanne some
  damning tales of late rising during her absence&mdash;please send this
  telegram off before breakfast; that is, before <i>your</i>
  breakfast."</p>

  <p>Evangeline curtseyed and withdrew. I had spent my leisure moments
  during the week teaching her the trick, as a surprise for Suzanne on her
  return.</p>

  <p>Next morning, as I lay in bed thinking out the subject of my next
  Message to the Nation, I was gratified to notice that the rain had ceased
  and the sun was shining genially. I thought of Suzanne and the refreshing
  fruit in Suzanne's relatives' attractive gardens. Should I go after all?
  I rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"Has that wire gone yet?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Indeed I took it these two hours back," replied Evangeline.</p>

  <p>I looked at my watch and grunted.</p>

  <p>"Bring me a telegram-form," I commanded, "and some hotter hot
  water."</p>

  <p>So, having wired to Suzanne: "Malaria false alarm only passing effects
  of overwork coming by the one-thirty <font class="sc">Percival</font>," I
  found myself at tea-time being nursed back to health on
  mulberries-and-cream administered by the solicitous hands of
  Aunt-by-acquisition Lucy.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said to Suzanne a little later as we strolled in the
  direction of the fig-trees, "how did it go off&mdash;my first wire, I
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I think I did it very well," she replied; "I gave a most
  realistic exhibition of wifely concern, and the car had just come to take
  me to the station when your second wire arrived."</p>

  <p>"Then they didn't spot anything?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Suzanne&mdash;"no, I don't think so."</p>

  <p>After dinner that night I was playing billiards with Toby, who is
  Suzanne's aunt's nephew-by-marriage. We had the room to ourselves.</p>

  <p>"Dull part of the world this," he remarked. "By the way, what about
  that malaria of yours?"</p>

  <p>"What about it?" I observed shortly.</p>

  <p>"Comes and goes rather suddenly, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Very," I agreed. "It's one of the suddenest diseases ever
  invented."</p>

  <p>"'Invented' is a good word," said Toby. "You're a bit of an inventor,
  aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Are you venturing to imply&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I imply nothing. I merely state that this morning Suzanne came down
  to breakfast in her travelling-clothes. And that wasn't all."</p>

  <p>"Wasn't it?" I inquired weakly. "Tell me the worst."</p>

  <p>"All through breakfast," continued Toby with relish, "she was restless
  and off her feed, and appeared to be listening for something. Afterwards
  nothing could induce her to leave the house, and I myself caught her
  surreptitiously studying the time-table. Every time a step was heard
  coming up the drive she started to her feet. At last a telegraph-boy
  arrived. Before anybody could discover whom the wire was addressed to,
  Suzanne snatched it from the boy, tore it open, placed her hand in the
  region of her heart and exclaimed, 'Oh, how provoking! Poor
  Percival's&mdash;' then she turned it the right way up, looked
  unutterably foolish and meekly handed it over to Aunt Lucy. It was from
  the old lady's stockbroker and referred to some transaction or other in
  Housing Bonds."</p>

  <p>"And what did Aunt Lucy say?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, she just looked the least little bit surprised," replied Toby,
  "but she didn't utter. Suzanne had to embrace the muddiest of all the
  cocker pups to hide her flaming cheeks."</p>

  <p>"Well, what happened then?"</p>

  <p>"Then? Oh, then the telegraph-boy fished out another wire from his
  wallet. I took it, glanced at the envelope and handed it to Suzanne. This
  time she read it very gingerly before exclaiming in a highly unemotional
  voice: 'Oh, how provoking! Poor Percival's got one of his sudden attacks
  of malaria and can't come. So, if you don't mind, Aunt Lucy, I'll catch
  the eleven-fifteen back.' Aunt Lucy was very sympathetic and went up to
  help her with her packing, which was accomplished in a surprisingly short
  time; as a matter of fact she had practically done it all before
  breakfast. Just as she was going to drive off to the station up came
  another telegraph-boy. That was your second wire, and Suzanne didn't seem
  any too pleased to receive it. I'm not at all convinced," concluded Toby,
  "that your wife would make her fortune on the stage."</p>

  <p>"Do you think Aunt Lucy suspects?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Bless you, no. The dear old thing has the heart of a child."</p>

  <p>Maybe, but I have my doubts. Suzanne's aunt insisted on my staying a
  week as a preventive against a nervous breakdown, and the tonic with
  which she herself dosed me several times a day was the most repulsive
  beverage I had ever tasted, effectually ruining the savour of figs and
  mulberries. Can it be that Aunt Lucy is not only of a suspicious but also
  of a revengeful nature?</p>

  <p>Suzanne ridicules my doublings and declares that she could make her
  aunt swallow anything. I wish she could have made her swallow my
  tonic.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>It would certainly have been a thousand pities if the coming of Peace
  had deprived us of anything so cheerfully stimulating as the tales of
  "<font class="sc">Sapper</font>" (<font class="sc">Cyril McNeile</font>).
  His <i>Bull-Dog Drummond</i> (<font class="sc">Hodder and
  Stoughton</font>) shows all the old breathless invention as active as
  ever, while the pugnacity&mdash;to give it no stronger term&mdash;is
  wholly unrestrained, even by what might seem the unpromising atmosphere
  of Godalming in 1919. It would, of course, be utterly beyond my scope to
  give in barest outline any list of the wild and whirling events that
  begin when <i>Captain Hugh Drummond</i> selects the most encouraging of
  the answers to his "Bored ex-soldier" advertisement and meets the writer,
  a cryptic but lovely lady, in the Carlton lounge. (Judging by
  contemporary fiction, what histories could those walls reveal!) After
  that the affair almost instantly develops into one lurid sequence of
  battle, murder, bluff and the kind of ten-minutes-here-for-courtship
  which proves that there is a gentler side even to the process of tracking
  crime. As usual, though less in this business than most, because of the
  engaging humour of the hero, I experienced a mild sympathy for the
  arch-villains; and indeed they might well feel some bitterness when,
  after being described as the master-intellects of the age, the author
  required them to conduct their most secret affairs in a lighted
  ground-floor room with the curtains undrawn. Most of them turn out to be
  Bolshevists, or at least in the receipt of Soviet subsidies&mdash;though
  I see a well-known Labour Daily reviewed the plot as unconvincing. Odd!
  Anyhow, a rattling story.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I am aware that, in confessing to an entire ignorance of any one of
  the so-called <i>Books of Artemas</i>, I place myself in a minority so
  small as to be almost beneath notice. This certainly is how the
  publishers regard the matter if one may judge by their ecstatically
  jubilant, "Artemas has written a novel! 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net," on
  the wrapper of <i>A Dear Fool</i> (<font class="sc">Westall</font>).
  Well, I have read the novel carefully, even I trust generously, with the
  unhappy result that (knowing how elusive and individual a thing is
  laughter) I can hardly bring myself to say how dull I found it. But the
  fact remains. It is all about nothing&mdash;a preposterous little plot
  for the identification, at a wildly inhuman reception, of an anonymous
  dramatist, revealed finally as the journalist hero who was nearly sacked
  for writing the play's only bad notice. In my day I have met both editors
  and critics; even dramatists. I don't say they were all pleasant people;
  many of them were not. But&mdash;here is my point&mdash;practically every
  one of them had at least sufficient of our common humanity to prevent
  them from behaving for one instant as their representatives do in this
  book. Let us charitably leave it at that. Probably the next man I meet
  will have invited apoplexy over his enjoyment of the same pages that
  moved me only to an irritated bewilderment. You never can tell.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span>

  <p>I rather think that <i>The Man with the Rubber Soles</i> (<font
  class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</font>) is Sir <font class="sc">Alexander
  Bannerman's</font> firstling, at least as far as fiction is concerned. If
  so, many others will share my hope that it may prove to be the eldest of
  a large family. For the author has not merely the knack of telling a good
  mystery story in a way that keeps one interested until the last page is
  turned; he tells it in a curiously dry matter-of-fact way that makes
  really startling adventures seem the sort of thing that might happen to
  anybody. The story concerns the pursuit of a gang of men who are engaged
  in importing forged Treasury notes on a large scale and uttering them
  through skilfully organised agencies. The police and various civilians
  between them&mdash;there is no super-sleuth to weary us with his
  machine-like prowess&mdash;run the thing to earth, partly by skill and
  partly by good luck, and the civilians in particular have a stirring time
  doing it. Bombs, automatic pistols, even soldiers and a submarine, assist
  quite naturally in sustaining the interest. And a pleasant little romance
  is really woven into the plot, not just pushed in anyhow. Altogether
  <i>The Man with the Rubber Soles</i> is a most excellent story of its
  kind, a real novel because plot and treatment are alike new, and one can
  safely prophesy that when Sir <font class="sc">Alexander Bannerman</font>
  produces his nextling he will find a large and appreciative circle of
  readers waiting to welcome it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Three things charmed me particularly about <i>Henry Elizabeth</i>
  (<font class="sc">Hurst and Blackett</font>), whose remarkable second
  name was due to the fact that he was born in the same year as the Virgin
  Queen and that his father had hoped that he too would be a girl. In the
  first place he became the greatest swordsman of his age and I was thus
  able to add him to my fine collection of Elizabethan heroes who have
  achieved this honour. What happens when two of these champions meet in
  those shadowy regions of romance where all costume novels are merged I do
  not know. It must be rather like the irresistible force and the immovable
  object. In the second place <i>H.E.</i> (no one could better deserve
  these formidable initials) was given the job of clearing Lundy Island of
  its piratical tenants, and I happened to have Lundy Island just opposite
  me as I read the book. It is not often that a reviewer has the chance of
  checking local colour with so little pains. And in the third place Mr.
  <font class="sc">Justin Huntly McCarthy</font> informs me, on page 101,
  that his hero will "gaze one day upon rivers to which the Thames should
  seem little better than a pitiful rivulet." As <i>Henry</i> never gets
  further from his native Devon than London in the course of this novel I
  take it that this is a delicate allusion to the possibility of a sequel.
  I hope it is so, and that I shall hear of <i>Henry</i> in days to come,
  after a trip or two with <font class="sc">Raleigh</font> or <font
  class="sc">Drake</font>, rebuilding his manor of Braginton, which was
  unfortunately burnt to the ground, and settling down to plant potatoes
  and tobacco in prosperity and peace.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>From the title, <i>Brute Gods</i> (<font class="sc">Heinemann</font>),
  you may guess that Mr. <font class="sc">Louis Wilkinson's</font> new
  novel does not deal with homely topics in a vein of harmless frolic. In
  recommending this very serious work of an expert author and observer, I
  am bound to make some reservation. Unsophisticated youth, if such there
  be in these days, should be kept away from the affair between <i>Alec
  Glaive</i> and <i>Gillian Collett</i>. <i>Alec</i>, a mere boy, was in a
  dangerously unsettled condition when the lady crossed his path. His
  mother had upset a not too happy family by eloping with a literary
  <i>poseur</i>; the egoism of his father had been rendered even more
  oppressive and his sarcasm even more acid thereby; and a Roman Catholic
  priest, intent on securing a convert for his Order, had been plying his
  young mind with too exciting conversations and too refreshing wines.
  Apart from external circumstances, <i>Alec</i> was tending to quarrel
  with humanity at large, and so he went the whole hog, more in search of a
  desperate ideal than by way of impetuous sin. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Wilkinson</font> treats the affair with deliberate,
  cold-blooded, even cynical analysis; and his portrayal of the snobbery
  and humbug of the upper-middle class, social and intellectual, in which
  his creatures move is searching and disturbing. But, I ask myself, are
  people really like that? Or rather are there enough of these unnaturals,
  extremists, moral Bolshevists or whatever you like to call them, to
  justify their presentation as a modern type? Always an optimist, I think
  not; and I notice that the author gives a no less clever and a much more
  convincing impression of the normal, settled and pleasant characters who
  are incidental to the plot. Make for yourself the acquaintance of the
  charming <i>Wilfred Vail</i> and the most amusing and seductive Cockney
  artiste, <i>Betty Barnfield</i>, and you will admit, however pessimistic
  your views, that there may be something in mine.</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
